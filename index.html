    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>When I first started coding I knew literally nothing. One of the first things that threw me off was binary. It felt like I was learning a new language with just 0s and 1s, and I couldn’t wrap my head around how that connected to real programs. At first, writing even a basic if else statement felt confusing, and debugging was frustrating because I didn’t always know what I was looking for. But over time with practice I begun to understand the concepts more and more. I got more comfortable using arrays to organize data, and I started understanding how loops could make code more efficient. Even though I messed up a lot, those mistakes actually helped me learn. One of the hardest parts was figuring out how to break problems down—sometimes I’d stare at a blank screen not even knowing where to start. But after practicing with different challenges and projects, I learned how to plan out my code and think logically. While I'm not the best programmer, I am very satisfied with the progress I've made throughout the year. I am very thankful to Mr. Alvarado and the wisdom he shared.</p>

    <h2>About the Project & What I Learned</h2>
    <p>This website is a personal portfolio that includes an About Me section introducing who I am and what I do, as well as a Project Gallery showcasing the projects I’ve built this year. It features a clean and modern design that reflects my personal style and includes fully responsive and functional links to live project demos.</p>
    <p>Throughout the year, I’ve learned to build and style web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, debug and enhance interactive features, and use version control with Git while deploying websites through GitHub Pages.</p>
